This is a collection of scripts that can be used with the Praat speech analysis program (Boersma & Weenink, 2012), originally posted at
http://individual.utoronto.ca/huiwen_goy/About_this_collection.html in 2012 and now archived here as well.

The scripts have been sorted into folders according to their general function, and the filename of each script contains a very brief description of what the script does.
