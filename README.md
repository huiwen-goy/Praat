#### About this project ####
 
This is a collection of scripts that can be used with the Praat speech analysis program (Boersma & Weenink), originally archived on my personal page at the University of Toronto and now archived here as well.
 
The scripts have been sorted into folders according to their general function. The filename of each script contains a very brief description of what the script does.
